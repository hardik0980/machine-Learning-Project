# Wine Quality Prediction: Using by SVM and Random Forest Classifier

Now that we've come to an end let's look back upon what we did in this project!

1. imported the required libraries!

2. read our data from the Red Wine Quality dataset!

3. Checked for any missing values!

4. Found some useful information between different features using plots and graphs!

5. Made a heatmap to find the correlation between different features!

6. Split the data into training and test sets!

7. Trained our model using supervised learning algorithm - Random forest classification & Super Vector Machine !

8. Accuracy of the Super vector machine model on testing data is 0.853125 %

9. Accuracy of the random forest classifier model on testing data is 0.896875 %
